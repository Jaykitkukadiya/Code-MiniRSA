# Code-miniRSA

The Code-miniRsa is a lightweight Python implementation of the RSA algorithm, designed to illustrate the core principles of RSA encryption, decryption, and digital signatures using small key sizes. This project serves as an educational tool for understanding the mechanics of RSA without the complexity of too large prime numbes.

#### Features:
- Key Generation: Generates P, Q N, Phi(N), Public-private key pairs, and verifies the keys under 9 miliseconds.
- Encryption & Decryption: able to encrypt and decrypt information quickly.
- Digital Signatures: able to generate and verify the signature.

#### Syntext:
